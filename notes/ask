I have an app which is a platform for helping blind people learn a new language.
The app is navigable using audio commands and audio feedback from a narator.
The app displays vocabular exercises with options to be answeared by the user.

The app has a number of modules named stories. Each story has a couple of building blocks and an epilogue.
A building block consists of a introduction of the words (the words are narated and explained by the narator), then
a questions with variants for the user to learn the translation of a individual word. These questions repeat untill a user knows 
to point the right translation at least 2 times in a row for each particular word.
The epilogue is an exercises which consists of a narated short story which contains words from the building blocks of the story,
but also some words from the previous stories that were learn so far.

The app uses technologies from Google Cloud:
1. Dialog Flow API - indentifies intention for vocal commands from the user - it's used by the backend
2. Text to speech - generates audio files for learning lessons, generates audio files for navigation assistance - it's just one time or 2 times occurences. The developers use this service to add lesson materials.
3. Speech to text - takes audio commands from the user microfone and generates text which will be processed by Dialog Flow in the backend
4. Cloud Storage - stores the audio files mentionat at 2.
5. Cloud Firestore - stores database model for lessons, the progress of the user for the lessons and other things for the app to work
6. Firebase Authentication - helps the user authenticate using Google, email
7. App Engine - hosts the web site
8. Cloud Source Repositories - hosts the code and helps with pipelines and deployment
9. React Typescript - the frontend technology
10. Nodejs - the backend technology


====================================


I was thinking about the following diagram:

App Engine contains the Web App which is a inner block.
The web browser -> Web App. 
Web App -> Speech To Text
Speech to text -> Dialog Flow

From Dialog Flow there is a bunch of arrrows to the following blocks:
    -> Firebase authentication
    -> Feature: Navigation and audio feedback
    -> Feature: Learning module and lessons

From "Feature: Navigation and audio feedback" 
    -> Cloud Firestore 
    -> Cloud Storage
From "Feature: Learning module and lessons" 
    -> Cloud Firestore 
    -> Cloud Storage

From Text To Speech -> Cloud Storage

Draw this diagram and ask me if you did draw it as I wanted. Then I want to ask you about what do you think about it.
